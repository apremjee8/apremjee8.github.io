It doesn't matter what career your are in or what level you are at in that career. In fact, I recently listened to a podcast where Taimur Abdaal read a quote that said that the further up you go in the corporate ladder, the more your role title changes to professional writer. Writing is how we communicate our thoughts, build connections, and make sure that the things that need to get done actually do get done.\\nBuilding this habit is especially important for me since I'm going into medicine. I think there is a big disconnect between the medical community and the rest of the world (patients, lawmakers, etc) because there is a language barrier. Doctors speak in the language of medicine, thinking in diagnoses and symptoms and this language isn't directly translatable to others. As someone in science, I need to be able to articulate my thoughts in clear ways so that I can have a bigger impact in the future. \"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Learning in Public\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Not all writing has to be public (and I think that it's a good idea to have some writing that isn't public and just for yourself) but I started this Digital Garden with the idea of learning in public in mind.

You build in a feedback cycle by just posting publicly. It's scary and I'm definitely afraid of judgement and what others will think but it's also liberating and great when you find people who resonate with your ideas. \"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Finding your crowd\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When you write and learn in public, you also expose yourself to people who share similar interests to you.

Posting what you write will attract people who are also interested in that thing and you can build relationships through this and be exposed to the work that others are creating as well. Sometimes it may seem like the things that you are interested in are niche and it's hard to find others who share those interests.

This does two things - 1) it slows our brain down and lets us reflect on what we are consuming and 2) it forces us to take time out to make sure we actually understand what we are consuming.

It's a freeing feeling (at least for me) and though it might be easier to sit and binge Netflix or YouTube in your free time, I've found that after I write my mind feels better and I feel proud of having created something on my own. It's also wonderful to go back through the archives and read different things that you wrote a while back to see what your headspace was at a different time.
