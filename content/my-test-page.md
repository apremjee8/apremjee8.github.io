Trying two things: creating a test page and also linking to [[GitHub]].

This idea is inspired from [Max Stoiber](https://notes.mxstbr.com/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). This project is [opensource](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com/), built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and uses [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/).
